# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Corona Blaster"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project will be a Space Invaders based game with some added functionality.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The main game will consist of having COVID spikes bounce back and forth across the screen and slowly drop down towards the vaccine (syringe) at the bottom of the screen. The player will earn points by using the syringe to launch a vaccine at the COVID spikes in order to stop them from hitting the syringe. There will be a special "fast" COVID spike that is twice the speed of the other COVID Spikes which works its way down the screen as well. There will be a life counter which gives the player three lives and will allow the syringe to be hit by the COVID spikes until the lives run out. Players will have the chance at periodic points throughout the game to hit a very small mask which will grant them an extra life. I hope to be able to create a main menu consisting of a difficulty setting which will change the number of COVID spikes and their speeds. I would also like to add a leader board to the game which will save high scores even after the program is exited.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be for the main game to work well including the additions of the life counter, the fast COVID spike, and the extra life mask.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a functing main menu with the option to start the game and to change the difficulty setting.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the game would be for all of the previous functionality to work as well as creating a permanent leader board which will allow the user to input their name and tie it to their score even after the game is closed.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have already researched code to create the core gamplay and based my code off of the code found in the video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w. I have also already acquired the necessary graphics to make this a COVID themed game. I will next need to add the extra functionality that I have proposed. I need to do further research into game main menus and creating leaderboards. This may take some time as I do not have any experience with this. I will also go through my code to look for areas where it can be optimized and condensed.
