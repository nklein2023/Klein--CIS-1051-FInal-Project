# Klein--CIS-1051-Final-Project
Title: Corona Blaster;
Author: Nicholas Klein

## What I enjoyed and learned:
My favorite part about this project was learning to how to use Tkinter and Pygame becasue I haven't had any coding experience before this course. I also enjoyed being able to solve some of the issues I faced with the knowledge I gained from this course.

## Difficulties I had:
One obstacle I was able to overcome was figuring out how to create a working game menu. I had origionally tried to create a game and menu class and it wasn't working for what I wanted to accomplish. I eventually settled on using Tkinter because it was easier to understand and I was able to utilize it to accomplish almost all of my goals. I was able to create a difficulty setting dropdown menu and a start button. The only goal that I wasn't able to fully meet was to create a seperate pop out menu with a leaderboard of approximately the top 5 scores and the initials next to them. After much time and research, I did come up with a solution to display the top score and initials on the main menu, though. I decided to create a file that could be read, written to, and the displayed onto the main menu.
