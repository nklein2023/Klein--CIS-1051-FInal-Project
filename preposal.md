# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I will be following the game track for this final project.
I will possibly create a GUI for a classic video game (i.e. pong, pac man).

Other game ideas:
  Card game using the random module
  Maze game using a turtle
  Use pygame functions to make it easier to code a game and add graphics
 
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?
If I found some code for a pong game on the internet and used some of that to create a pong game but also add a GUI and some other functionality to it would that be acceptable or would I need to start the code from scratch.
