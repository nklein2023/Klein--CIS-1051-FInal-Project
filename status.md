Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have created the core gameplay with the COVID theme. I have created the enemies and added a "fast" enemy as well. I have a life and score counter as well as extra life opportunities throughout the game. I have created a main menu for the game using Tkinter which has the options to start the game, set the difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and displays the highest score and who attained that score.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not created a seperate popup menu with a leaderboard of all of the top scores.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Creating the menu took me the longest time because I had no experience with that before. I attempted to create various classes and they didn't seem to help me with what I wanted to do. I then moved on to tkinter and created a few widgets to display. Overall, I am very pleased with what I have accomplished in this project.
